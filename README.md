# Teapot
A teapot stored on GitHub. Let's brew some coffee with it.

## Usage
`node brew_coffee.js`

## Why coffee? ☕️ 
For those who don't know, there's a clever little HTTP response code specifically for attempting to brew coffee with a teapot. Response code 418 states 
```"Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout."```

## Why did you waste any amount of life force on this?
I got bored, and I wanted to test console.log() formatting. Hence, the pretty colors.
