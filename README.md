# Teapot
A teapot stored on GitHub. Let's brew some coffee with it.

### Why brew some coffee?
For those who don't know, there's a clever little HTTP response code specifically for attempting to brew coffee with a teapot. Response code 418 states 
```"Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout."```
